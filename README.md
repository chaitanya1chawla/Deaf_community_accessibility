# Deaf Community Accessibility

Repository for converting American Sign Language (ASL) to speech/text 

Used in TUM Hackathon 2022 for the Microsoft challenge - making Microsoft Teams more accessible for the Deaf people.

As a team of 4, we wanted to develop a two-way model. 

The first part was to convert text(subtitles generated by microsoft teams) to ASL, by showing the actions on an animated figure.

Second part was to convert ASL to text (as subtitles).
