# Text-to-Text

Translation between spoken and signed language texts.

## Main Idea

We use [bergamot](https://browser.mt/) to train machine translation models between spoken and signed language texts (as
SignWriting or HamNoSys).
These models are then available for inference both on server side, and in the browser for offline translation.

## Instructions

- Data collection instructions are found in [data/README.md](data/README.md)
- Installation and training instructions are found in [bergamot/INSTRUCTIONS.md](bergamot/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
